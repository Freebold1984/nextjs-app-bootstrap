Brittany Ferries Security Improvement Plan
=========================================

I. Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)
-------------------------------
1. Update scanning tools:
   - Upgrade to SQLMap 1.9+ or equivalent
   - Add OWASP ZAP for comprehensive scanning

2. Expand test coverage:
   - Include authenticated user testing
   - Test all user roles (customer, admin, etc.)
   - Cover all application workflows

II. Medium-Term Improvements (1-3 months)
----------------------------------------
1. Implement continuous security testing:
   - Schedule weekly automated scans
   - Monthly manual penetration tests

2. Enhance security controls:
   - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
   - Enable subresource integrity (SRI)

3. Vulnerability management:
   - Establish patching SLA (critical: 24h, high: 7d)
   - Create vulnerability disclosure program

III. Long-Term Strategy (3-6 months)
-----------------------------------
1. Security training:
   - Developer security awareness
   - Secure coding practices
   - Threat modeling workshops

2. Security architecture:
   - Implement zero-trust principles
   - Add runtime application self-protection (RASP)
   - Enhance logging and monitoring

3. Compliance:
   - Align with PCI DSS if processing payments
   - Consider ISO 27001 certification

IV. Testing Methodology Improvements
-----------------------------------
1. Comprehensive test types:
   - SQL injection (re-test with updated tools)
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
   - Broken authentication testing
   - Sensitive data exposure checks

2. Testing frequency:
   - Automated scans: Weekly
   - Manual penetration tests: Quarterly
   - After major releases: Mandatory

V. Monitoring and Maintenance
----------------------------
1. Continuous monitoring:
   - 24/7 security monitoring
   - Real-time alerting for suspicious activity

2. Maintenance schedule:
   - Monthly security updates
   - Quarterly architecture reviews
   - Annual full security audit
